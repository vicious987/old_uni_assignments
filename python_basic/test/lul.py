Hah!
Two to the one, to the one to the three,
I'll take that Battle Fury!
Tidehunter, rot in a sun!
Damn, I thought this bottle would have rum.
Three to the one, to the one to the three,
True peace is only at sea!
All's shipshape from stern to scupper,
Tidehunter, you're not like another.
Sweetly, sweetly blew the breeze, on me alone it blew.
I'll take that, hand it over!
Ha, denied, no gold for you!
Tidehunter, you left too soon.
To the deeps with you, lowered the boom!
Hie thee to battle!
I dub thee, aye, Scepter!
RAMMING SPEED!

If the demons of the Cataract couldn't sink my fleet, then this lot doesn't stand a chance!

Ha-ha-ha!

I haven't seen such a pack of tree weasels since we rousted the Trembling Isles free of all the... tree weasels!

Look sharp!

SPLAY ğŸ’¦ THAT ğŸ’¦ BOOTY ğŸ’¦ OUTğŸ’¦

SPLAY ğŸ’¦ THAT ğŸ’¦ BOOTY ğŸ’¦ OUTğŸ’¦

SPLAY ğŸ’¦ THAT ğŸ’¦ BOOTY ğŸ’¦ OUTğŸ’¦
SPLAY ğŸ’¦ THAT ğŸ’¦ BOOTY ğŸ’¦ OUTğŸ’¦
(Not so safe harbor, eh?)
SPLAY ğŸ’¦ THAT ğŸ’¦ BOOTY ğŸ’¦ OUTğŸ’¦

Uh, belay that last order!
